Hi! My name is Filipe Paccetti, and I work as a senior quant in the financial sector. Besides having an interest in several quantitative fields ranging from complex differential geometry to deep learning, I am a keen reader on history and linguistics.

I hold a PhD in theoretical physics, having worked as a researcher in mathematical physics before joining the financial sector.
