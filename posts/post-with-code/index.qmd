This is a post with equations and code. An *ancient* way of estimating the value of $\pi$ is to estimate the area $A$ of a circle using some numerical method and then divide $A$ by the diameter $d$.

```{r}

n = 1000 # sample size

x = runif(n)
y = runif(n)
r2 = x^2+y^2
A_4 = sum(r2<=1)/n

print(paste0('A simulation of size ',n,' leads to an estimated pi of ',4*A_4))
```
